High:
[ ] Draw the deformed grid
[ ] Verify that ddm implemenation works (or does not work)
[ ] Generalize to arbitrary width / height
[ ] Profiling
[x] Make it possible to run the simplest example
[x] Pythons modulo differs from c++, need to do: ((x % n) + n) % n to make them the work same
[x] Find the bugs
[x] Need to evaluate the proper fourier coefficients at fftn and ifftn
    see: DiffeoFunctionMatching.cpp rows 437, 438, 446, 447
    [x] Investigate how the fourier coefficients are solved in np.fft.fftn abd np.fft.ifftn
[x] Add test cases for core lib
[x] Add gtest to failing function(s)
[x] Add gtest to the project structure
[x] Separate code from example app to ddmatchLib so we can test it
[x] Replace usage of dImage with TGrid<double> in DiffeoFunctionMatching
[x] Replace usage of dImage with TGrid<double> in Diffeo_functions
[x] Fix so it's possible to use const operator[] in TGrid TCube etc
[x] Fix DFT / iDFT
[x] Add properly implemented FFT / iFFT
[x] Seems ICZT contains errors
[x] chirp-z
  [x] Evaluate W^(k^2/2), W^(-k^2/2) and A^(-k)
[x] Add test cases for ZeroPad

Unit testing:
[ ] Add more test cases to make sure code conversion works as expected
[ ] Add test cases for TCube
[ ] Need to think over more of what I want to test here
  [ ] Add test cases for FFT/IFFT
  [ ] Add test cases for CZT/ICZT
  [ ] Add test cases for DFT/IDFT
[ ] These are semi-public functions, the most important ones are FFT/IFFT, CZT/ICZT, DFT/IDFT
  [ ] Add test cases for CirculantMultiply
  [ ] Add test cases for SkewCirculantMultiply
  [ ] Add test cases for ToeplitzMultiplyE
  [ ] Add test cases for ToeplitzMultiplyP

Notes (low):
[ ] cleanup stage (mostly I've bloated the ImageLib with unused functions)
[ ] gtest: Replace printf() with std::cout to be able to prune the output while running tests?

WON'T FIX:
[ ] Wrap vec<vec<double>> to something else for efficiency?
  REASON: already done differently
