High:
[ ] Make it possible to run the simplest example
[ ] Generalize to arbitrary width / height
[x] Replace usage of dImage with TGrid<double> in DiffeoFunctionMatching
[x] Replace usage of dImage with TGrid<double> in Diffeo_functions
[x] Fix so it's possible to use const operator[] in TGrid TCube etc

Medium:
[ ] When we have something that works write rudimentary gtests

Notes (low):
[ ] Wrap vec<vec<double>> to something else for efficiency?
[ ] cleanup stage (mostly I've bloated the ImageLib with unused functions)

Fine tuning (low low):
[ ] Preparing gtest: Replace printf() with std::cout to be able to prune the output while running tests?
