High:
[ ] Add gtest to failing function(s)
[ ] Make it possible to run the simplest example
[ ] Generalize to arbitrary width / height
[x] Add gtest to the project structure
[x] Separate code from example app to ddmatchLib so we can test it
[x] Replace usage of dImage with TGrid<double> in DiffeoFunctionMatching
[x] Replace usage of dImage with TGrid<double> in Diffeo_functions
[x] Fix so it's possible to use const operator[] in TGrid TCube etc

Notes (low):
[ ] Wrap vec<vec<double>> to something else for efficiency?
[ ] cleanup stage (mostly I've bloated the ImageLib with unused functions)

Fine tuning (low low):
[ ] Preparing gtest: Replace printf() with std::cout to be able to prune the output while running tests?
