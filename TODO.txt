High:
[ ] Seems ICZT contains errors
[ ] chirp-z
  [x] Evaluate W^(k^2/2), W^(-k^2/2) and A^(-k)
[ ] Add test cases for CZT/ICZT
[ ] Add test cases for dft/idft, fft/ifft
[ ] Add test cases for ZeroPad
[ ] Add test cases for CirculantMultiply
[ ] Add test cases for SkewCirculantMultiply
[ ] Add test cases for ToeplitzMultiplyE
[ ] Add test cases for ToeplitzMultiplyP
[ ] Add test cases for TCube
[ ] Add more test cases to make sure code conversion works as expected
[ ] Pythons modulo differs from c++, need to do: ((x % n) + n) % n to make them the work same
    Maybe just add n if result is negative for performance reasons?
[ ] Make it possible to run the simplest example
[ ] Generalize to arbitrary width / height
[x] Add properly implemented FFT / iFFT
[x] Fix DFT / iDFT
[x] Add test cases for core lib
[x] Add gtest to failing function(s)
[x] Add gtest to the project structure
[x] Separate code from example app to ddmatchLib so we can test it
[x] Replace usage of dImage with TGrid<double> in DiffeoFunctionMatching
[x] Replace usage of dImage with TGrid<double> in Diffeo_functions
[x] Fix so it's possible to use const operator[] in TGrid TCube etc

Notes (low):
[ ] cleanup stage (mostly I've bloated the ImageLib with unused functions)
[ ] gtest: Replace printf() with std::cout to be able to prune the output while running tests?

WON'T FIX:
[ ] Wrap vec<vec<double>> to something else for efficiency?
  REASON: already done differently
